# Introduction

This project is a work in progress online bookstore API built with Spring Boot, designed to hone my Spring Boot development skills and explore RESTful API development.

RESTful API Endpoints:
/books: Retrieve a list of all books (GET).
/books/{id}: Retrieve a specific book by its ID (GET).
/books: Create a new book (POST).
(Planned) /books/{id}: Update an existing book (PUT).
(Planned) /books/{id}: Delete a book (DELETE).
(In progress) User Authentication: Implement user login and authorization for secure access.
(Planned) Swagger endpoint generation
